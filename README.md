# Statistical Significance of Genetic Functional Networks Using Edge Density 

## Description
Input is two tab-delimited files named 'Input.gmt' and 'STRING.txt'. Input.gmt is a 
tab-delimited file formatted as Broad Instituteâ€™s Gene Matrix Transformed (GMT). STRING.txt 
is a version of the STRING database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions. 
Each line in the string file represents an edge in the network between the protein genes 
formatted protein'\t'protein'\t'weight'\n' where weight is the strength of their functional 
similarity. 
Random subnetworks are created from the Input.gmt.txt file where there is one random node
picked from each loci. For each node in the loci subnetwork an equivalent node in the 
STRING database is picked. Equivalent nodes from the STRING database are determined by 
organizing the nodes into quantile bins based on their edge density and picking a node 
that has a similar density to the one in the loci subnetwork.
These subnetworks are then compared for statistical significance to determine if the genes
chosen from the loci subnetwork are more functionally connected than a random set of genes.
This is done by computing the empirical p-value based on the subnetworks densities.

## Goal
Compute the statistical significance of a population of subnetworks from a 
set of FA loci compared to the STRING database.
